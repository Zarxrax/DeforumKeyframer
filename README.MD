# DeforumKeyframer

## What this is
This is a macro for Davinci Resolve/Fusion to assist with creating keyframes for Deforum Stable Diffusion. You can view your keyframes on the timeline, making it easier to visualize your animation or synchronize to music and video.

## What this is NOT
This does not bring Stable Diffusion into Davinci Resolve. It simply generates a list of keyframe data that can be copied into Deforum Stable Diffusion.

## This is currently alpha software
It may not work well or even at all. Future releases may break your existing projects. Please do not use for serious work at this point in time.

## First release coming soon
